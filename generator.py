Guidelines:
1. Keep all descriptions extremely concise - no more than 1-2 sentences
2. Make the scenario realistic and business-focused
3. Best case should be ambitious but achievable
4. Worst case should be conservative but not disastrous
5. Consequences should be balanced and make sense for the situation
6. Next scenarios should be relevant to the current scenario
7. Ensure all numeric values are integers
8. Make the scenario specific to the business profile provided
